            <p>I’m a full-stack developer with well over 20+ years in problem solving, coaching, and training. I’m doing
                back flips
                while taking this leap of faith and ready to stick my landing and transition into a career in tech. This
                journey is
                being driven by my curiosity of the unknown and my need for challenges. In the past, challenges have
                ushered growth. I
                have a proven track record of being successful with measurable growth in dynamic environments. My record
                will highlight
                my ability to independently seek organizational change and resolutions. Working with diverse groups,
                seeking out
                differing opinions, and an unwavering commitment to the vision of the organization. History of
                assembling, managing,
                contributing, and learning about highly productive teams. Demonstrated ability to work, create a plan
                to, and
                communicate across teams and organizations to accomplish goals. My career in tech started with I.T. work
                in college.
                This is where my interest in graphic design lead me to pursue Marketing. Reality of not discovering
                niche market
                rerouted me a career in retail management. This offered me the opportunity to be creative and grow in my
                Marketing
                experience. In Education, my curiosity with tech ramped us as I utilized tech to teach, communicate,
                create efficiency
                school-wide, brand, and market. Open to change and a drive to be challenged, I’m on the journey to
                becoming a full-stack
                software engineer. Let’s sit down and discuss a future with your organization, not just a job.</p>
